    			<h2>Take-home Message</h2>
    			<p>In the last paragraph of the entire essay, the writer talks about future plans for retrieval missions. He reveals proudness and excitement by stating that the rover will be British-built and that people are about to enter the most exciting time of space exploration on Mars. In conclusion, we can see that the writer tries <span style="background-color: #80cdc1">to leave a successful image for the space mission to his readers</span>.

    				<q>Plans for this retrieval exercise are well advanced. It will involve Nasa and its partners in the European Space Agency sending another rover to "fetch" the samples from wherever Perseverance stores them in the crater.
					It will be a British-built vehicle. It will pick up the samples and transfer them to a rocket which will then blast them into Mars orbit where a satellite freighter will be waiting to ferry them home.
					"We are about to enter the most exciting time in the exploration of Mars," said Sue Horne, the head of space exploration at the UK Space Agency.
					"Soon the dream of examining specimens from the Red Planet will become a reality as the locomotion system of the Sample Fetch Rover is tested next
