         My name is Guan-Yu Lin. You can also call me Mark in English. I was born and raised in a busy family in Hsinchu City, Taiwan. I have two sisters and I am the youngest in my family. When I was young, they were already in their college life. Because of this, I seldom have interaction with family members, which, I believe, contributes to my present shy personality. In hindsight, I do not see it as a defection; instead, I treat it as a blessing as my shy personality encourages me to dive into the world of the Internet at an early age. It makes me fall in love with video games, especially FPS games. I played so well that in 2016, I got recruited into an American clan, called 1percenter. I even had a chance to represent the clan to compete against other teams. I had a lot of fun and also learned a lot, including the spirit of teamwork and ways of communication. Moreover, my English skill also started to kick off at the time. Using a computer so frequently also makes me wonder how a computer functions, so I started researching by myself. Surprisingly, during the summer vacation in 2021, I managed to build my own personal computer, using the parts I chose by myself and, of course, my own pocket money I had saved for years. It made me realize that as long as I am willing to spend effort and time on something, I can create wonderful results. Looking back at these, I feel satisfied with what I have experienced and achieved. Right now, I am on my way to a new chapter of my life as a freshman at DFLL in NTHU. I am excited and looking forward to further improving my English ability and making it the foundation to explore other fields of knowledge.
